# Encryption and Key Management Policy

## 1. Purpose
This policy establishes practical encryption and key management standards for IBP, leveraging AWS-native services for secure operations.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all data encryption and cryptographic key management across:
- AWS cloud infrastructure
- BMS application data
- Communication and file storage
- Development and production environments

## 3. Encryption Requirements

### 3.1 Data at Rest Encryption
All data must be encrypted using AWS managed services:

```yaml
AWS Encryption Standards:
  S3 Buckets:
    - Enable default encryption with AWS KMS
    - Use AWS managed keys for simplicity
    - Enable bucket versioning for data protection
  
  RDS Databases:
    - Enable encryption at creation (cannot be added later)
    - Use AWS managed KMS keys
    - Enable automated backups with encryption
  
  EBS Volumes:
    - Enable default encryption at account level
    - Use AWS managed KMS keys
    - Apply to all new volumes automatically
```

### 3.2 Data in Transit Encryption
All communications must use TLS/HTTPS:

```yaml
Transport Encryption:
  Application Load Balancer:
    - TLS 1.2 minimum (prefer TLS 1.3)
    - Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates
    - Redirect HTTP to HTTPS automatically
  
  Database Connections:
    - Force SSL connections to RDS
    - Use SSL certificates for all database access
  
  API Communications:
    - HTTPS only for all API endpoints
    - No HTTP allowed in production
```

## 4. Key Management (Simplified)

### 4.1 AWS KMS Usage
Leverage AWS Key Management Service for all encryption keys:

```bash
# Enable default EBS encryption for the account
aws ec2 enable-ebs-encryption-by-default

# Create customer-managed key for sensitive data (optional)
aws kms create-key \
  --description "BMS sensitive data encryption" \
  --key-usage ENCRYPT_DECRYPT

# Enable automatic key rotation
aws kms enable-key-rotation --key-id <key-id>
```

### 4.2 Key Management Best Practices
Key management best practices:

```yaml
Key Management Practices:
  AWS Managed Keys:
    - Use for most encryption needs
    - Automatic rotation handled by AWS
    - No key management overhead
  
  Customer Managed Keys:
    - Only for highly sensitive data
    - Enable automatic annual rotation
    - Document key usage and purpose
  
  Application Secrets:
    - Store in AWS Secrets Manager
    - Enable automatic rotation for database passwords
    - Use IAM roles for access control
```

## 5. Implementation Checklist

### 5.1 Immediate Actions (Week 1)
- [ ] Enable EBS encryption by default
- [ ] Verify S3 bucket encryption is enabled
- [ ] Confirm RDS encryption is active
- [ ] Check ALB is using HTTPS with ACM certificates

### 5.2 Short-term Actions (Month 1)
- [ ] Migrate any unencrypted data to encrypted storage
- [ ] Set up Secrets Manager for application credentials
- [ ] Document all encryption implementations
- [ ] Train team on encryption best practices

## 6. Monitoring and Compliance

### 6.1 Automated Compliance Checks
Use AWS Config rules to monitor encryption compliance:

```bash
# Check S3 bucket encryption
aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule '{
  "ConfigRuleName": "s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled",
  "Source": {
    "Owner": "AWS",
    "SourceIdentifier": "S3_BUCKET_SERVER_SIDE_ENCRYPTION_ENABLED"
  }
}'

# Check RDS encryption
aws configservice put-config-rule --config-rule '{
  "ConfigRuleName": "rds-storage-encrypted",
  "Source": {
    "Owner": "AWS",
    "SourceIdentifier": "RDS_STORAGE_ENCRYPTED"
  }
}'
```

### 6.2 Regular Reviews
Regular review process:
- **Monthly**: Check AWS Config compliance dashboard
- **Quarterly**: Review and update encryption documentation
- **Annually**: Review encryption policy and practices

## 7. Emergency Procedures

### 7.1 Key Compromise Response
If encryption keys are suspected to be compromised:

1. **Immediate**: Disable the compromised key in KMS
2. **Within 1 hour**: Create new encryption key
3. **Within 24 hours**: Re-encrypt affected data
4. **Within 48 hours**: Update all applications to use new key
5. **Within 1 week**: Complete incident documentation

### 7.2 Data Recovery
For encrypted data recovery:
- Use AWS Backup for encrypted RDS and EBS recovery
- Leverage S3 versioning for file recovery
- Contact AWS support for complex key recovery scenarios

## 8. Training Requirements

### 8.1 Team Training
All team members must understand:
- Basic encryption concepts
- AWS encryption services usage
- Incident reporting procedures
- Compliance checking methods

### 8.2 Training Schedule
- **New team members**: Encryption basics during onboarding
- **All team**: Annual encryption awareness training
- **Technical team**: AWS encryption services training (as needed)
