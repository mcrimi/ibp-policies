# Data Management and Classification Policy

## 1. Purpose
This policy establishes comprehensive data management practices, classification standards, and handling procedures to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and availability across IBP and BMS systems.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all data processed, stored, or transmitted by IBP, including:
- Breeding and agricultural research data
- Personal and sensitive information
- Intellectual property and trade secrets
- System and operational data
- Third-party and customer data

## 3. Data Classification Framework

### 3.1 Classification Levels (Simplified)
IBP uses a practical three-tier data classification system:

| Classification | Description | Examples | Handling Requirements |
|----------------|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| **Public** | Information approved for public release | Published research, marketing materials | Standard security, HTTPS |
| **Internal** | Information for internal use only | Internal procedures, employee info, breeding data | Access controls, encryption at rest and transit |
| **Restricted** | Highly sensitive information | Personal data, financial data, credentials | Maximum security controls, need-to-know basis |

### 3.2 Data Classification Criteria

#### Confidentiality Impact
- **High**: Unauthorized disclosure could cause severe harm to IBP or individuals
- **Moderate**: Unauthorized disclosure could cause serious harm
- **Low**: Unauthorized disclosure would have minimal impact

#### Integrity Impact
- **High**: Unauthorized modification could cause severe operational or financial harm
- **Moderate**: Unauthorized modification could cause serious disruption
- **Low**: Unauthorized modification would have minimal impact

#### Availability Impact
- **High**: Service disruption could cause severe operational impact
- **Moderate**: Service disruption could cause serious inconvenience
- **Low**: Service disruption would have minimal impact

### 3.3 Classification Process
Practical approach for data classification:

```yaml
Data Classification Process:
  Step 1: Determine Classification
    - Is this public information? → Public
    - Contains personal/financial data? → Restricted
    - Everything else → Internal
  
  Step 2: Apply Controls
    - Public: HTTPS, standard backups
    - Internal: Encryption, access controls, AWS backups
    - Restricted: Maximum encryption, MFA, audit logging
  
  Step 3: Document and Label
    - Tag in AWS (Data-Classification: Public/Internal/Restricted)
    - Document in data inventory
    - Review annually
```

## 4. Data Labeling and Handling

### 4.1 Data Labeling Standards
Consistent labeling across all data formats:

#### Electronic Data Labeling
```yaml
Metadata Standards:
  Classification_Level: [Public|Internal|Restricted]
  Data_Owner: [Department/Individual]
  Retention_Period: [Years/Months]
  Privacy_Category: [Personal|Non-Personal|Special Category]
  Handling_Instructions: [Encryption Required|Access Restricted|etc.]
  Review_Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
```

#### Document Labeling
- **Header/Footer markings** on all pages
- **Classification banners** for electronic documents
- **Watermarks** for sensitive documents
- **Version control** with classification tracking

### 4.2 Handling Procedures by Classification

#### Public Data Handling
- **Storage**: Standard cloud storage with basic security
- **Transmission**: Standard HTTPS encryption
- **Access**: General access controls
- **Retention**: Business-driven retention periods

#### Internal Data Handling
- **Storage**: Encrypted storage with access logging
- **Transmission**: TLS 1.2+ encryption required
- **Access**: Role-based access controls
- **Retention**: Defined retention schedules

#### Confidential Data Handling
- **Storage**: AES-256 encryption at rest, separate key management
- **Transmission**: End-to-end encryption with certificate validation
- **Access**: Multi-factor authentication, need-to-know basis
- **Retention**: Strict retention with secure disposal

#### Restricted Data Handling
- **Storage**: Hardware security module (HSM) protected encryption
- **Transmission**: Encrypted channels with mutual authentication
- **Access**: Privileged access management, continuous monitoring
- **Retention**: Minimal retention with cryptographic erasure

## 5. Data Lifecycle Management

### 5.1 Data Creation and Collection
Secure data handling from the point of creation:

#### Data Input Validation for BMS Architecture
```java
// Example: Spring-based input validation for breeding data in BMS
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/phenotype")
public class PhenotypeController {
    
    @PostMapping("/measurement")
    public ResponseEntity<PhenotypeMeasurement> createMeasurement(
            @Valid @RequestBody PhenotypeMeasurementRequest request,
            @PathVariable String cropDatabase) {
        
        // BMS-specific crop database switching
        DatabaseContextHolder.setCurrentDatabase(cropDatabase);
        
        try {
            // Hibernate/JPA validation with custom BMS validators
            PhenotypeMeasurement measurement = phenotypeService.createMeasurement(request);
            return ResponseEntity.ok(measurement);
        } finally {
            DatabaseContextHolder.clearCurrentDatabase();
        }
    }
}

// BMS-specific validation annotations
@Entity
@Table(name = "phenotype_measurement")
public class PhenotypeMeasurement {
    
    @NotNull
    @DecimalMin(value = "0.0", message = "Phenotype value must be positive")
    @DecimalMax(value = "1000.0", message = "Phenotype value exceeds maximum")
    private BigDecimal value;
    
    @NotNull
    @Past(message = "Measurement date cannot be in the future")
    private LocalDate measurementDate;
    
    @BMSCropSpecific // Custom validation for crop-specific business rules
    private String cropType;
}
```

#### Data Quality Controls
- **Validation rules** for all data inputs
- **Duplicate detection** and resolution
- **Completeness checks** for required fields
- **Consistency verification** across related data sets

### 5.2 Data Processing and Analysis

### 5.3 Data Storage and Retention
Systematic approach to data storage and retention:

#### Storage Requirements by Classification

|----------------|------------|-----------------|--------|------------|
| Public | Optional | Basic | Standard | Basic |
| Internal | TLS in transit | RBAC | Encrypted | Standard |
| Confidential | AES-256 at rest/transit | MFA + RBAC | Encrypted + offsite | Enhanced |
| Restricted | HSM-protected | PAM + continuous | Encrypted + air-gapped | Real-time |

#### Retention Schedule Management
```yaml
Retention Policies:
  Breeding Data:
    Research_Data: 10 years after project completion
    Trial_Results: 7 years after publication
    Genetic_Material: Permanent with periodic review
  
  Personal Data:
    Employee_Records: 7 years after termination
    Customer_Data: 5 years after last interaction
    Marketing_Data: 2 years or until consent withdrawn
  
  Operational Data:
    System_Logs: 1 year for standard, 7 years for security
    Backup_Data: 90 days for daily, 7 years for annual
    Configuration_Data: 3 years after replacement
```

### 5.4 Data Disposal and Destruction
Secure disposal procedures for end-of-lifecycle data:

#### Disposal Methods by Storage Type
```bash
# Secure deletion procedures
# For cloud storage (S3)
aws s3api delete-object --bucket sensitive-data --key confidential-file.csv
aws s3api delete-object-tagging --bucket sensitive-data --key confidential-file.csv

# For database records
# Use application-level deletion with audit trail
DELETE FROM sensitive_table WHERE record_id = ? AND deletion_authorized = true;

# For encrypted storage
# Cryptographic erasure by key destruction
aws kms schedule-key-deletion --key-id alias/data-encryption-key --pending-window-in-days 7
```

#### Disposal Verification
- **Certificate of destruction** for physical media
- **Cryptographic erasure** verification for encrypted data
- **Audit trail** documentation for compliance
- **Third-party validation** for high-sensitivity data
