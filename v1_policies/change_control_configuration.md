#### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# AWS-native rollback automation
#!/bin/bash
STACK_NAME=$1
PREVIOUS_VERSION=$2

echo "Initiating rollback for CloudFormation stack $STACK_NAME"

# Rollback CloudFormation stack
aws cloudformation cancel-update-stack --stack-name $STACK_NAME
aws cloudformation continue-update-rollback --stack-name $STACK_NAME

# Rollback ECS service to previous task definition
aws ecs update-service --cluster bms-cluster --service bms-app \
  --task-definition bms-app:$PREVIOUS_VERSION

# Verify rollback using Application Load Balancer health checks
echo "Waiting for health checks to pass..."
aws elbv2 wait target-in-service --target-group-arn $TARGET_GROUP_ARN

# Check application health
health_check=$(aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn $TARGET_GROUP_ARN \
  --query 'TargetHealthDescriptions[0].TargetHealth.State' --output text)

if [ "$health_check" = "healthy" ]; then
    echo "Rollback successful - all targets healthy"
    # Send SNS notification
    aws sns publish --topic-arn $SNS_TOPIC_ARN \
      --message "Rollback completed successfully for $STACK_NAME"
else
    echo "Rollback verification failed, escalating to emergency response"
    aws sns publish --topic-arn $EMERGENCY_SNS_TOPIC_ARN \
      --message "URGENT: Rollback failed for $STACK_NAME - manual intervention required"
