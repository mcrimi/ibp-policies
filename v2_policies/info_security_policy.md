### 5.1 Comprehensive Risk Management Program
IBP maintains a documented, organization-wide risk management program that integrates risk assessment, treatment, monitoring, and communication across all business processes with defined governance structures for enterprise-wide risk oversight.

#### Risk Management Methodology
IBP employs a systematic approach to risk assessment that includes separate evaluation of inherent and residual risks:

**Inherent Risk Assessment:**
- Risk evaluation before considering existing controls
- Assessment of maximum potential impact and likelihood
- Baseline risk scoring using industry-standard methodologies
- Documentation of risk scenarios and threat analysis

**Residual Risk Assessment:**
- Risk evaluation after considering control effectiveness
- Assessment of remaining risk after mitigation measures
- Evaluation of control gaps and additional treatment needs
- Documented risk acceptance decisions with management approval

#### Risk Categories and Assessment Framework
```yaml
Risk Assessment Categories:
  Technical Risks:
    - System vulnerabilities and security weaknesses
    - Infrastructure failures and technology obsolescence
    - Cybersecurity threats and attack vectors
    - Data integrity and availability risks
  
  Operational Risks:
    - Process failures and human error
