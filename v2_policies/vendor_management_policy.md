# Vendor and Third Party Management Policy

## 1. Purpose
This policy establishes requirements for managing security risks associated with vendors, suppliers, and third-party service providers that support IBP and BMS operations.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all third-party relationships including:
- Cloud service providers (AWS, Google Workspace)
- Software vendors and SaaS providers
- Professional service providers
- Contractors and consultants
- Business partners and integrators

## 3. Vendor Risk Management Framework

### 3.1 Risk-Based Vendor Classification

IBP uses a simplified two-tier vendor classification system appropriate for a small organization:

| Classification | Risk Level | Examples | Due Diligence Required |
|----------------|------------|----------|------------------------|
| **Critical Vendors** | High risk - access to data or critical services | AWS, Google Workspace, payment processors | Comprehensive security review |
| **Standard Vendors** | Low risk - no direct data access | General business services, training providers | Basic security verification |

### 3.2 Vendor Risk Assessment Criteria

#### Critical Vendor Identification
A vendor is classified as "Critical" if they:
- Process, store, or transmit IBP or customer data
- Have administrative access to IBP systems
- Provide services essential to BMS operations

- Could significantly impact business operations if compromised

#### Risk Evaluation Factors
- **Data Access**: Type and sensitivity of data accessed
