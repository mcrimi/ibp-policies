  --config-rule-name ec2-security-group-attached-to-eni

# Custom drift detection script
#!/bin/bash
# Check for unauthorized changes
current_config=$(aws ec2 describe-security-groups --group-ids sg-12345678)
baseline_config=$(cat /baselines/sg-12345678-baseline.json)

if ! diff -q <(echo "$current_config") <(echo "$baseline_config") > /dev/null; then
    echo "Configuration drift detected in security group sg-12345678"
    # Trigger alert and remediation
fi
```

#### Automated Remediation

- **Escalation procedures** for persistent drift

## 6. Version Control and Release Management

### 6.1 Version Control Standards
Comprehensive version control for all configuration items:

#### Git Workflow for Infrastructure
```yaml
Git Branching Strategy:
  main:
    - Production-ready configurations
    - Protected branch with required reviews
    - Automated deployment to production
  
  develop:
    - Integration branch for new features
    - Continuous integration testing
    - Staging environment deployment
  
  feature/*:
    - Individual change branches
    - Pull request workflow
    - Peer review requirements
  
  hotfix/*:
    - Emergency fix branches
    - Fast-track approval process
    - Direct deployment capability
```

#### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
```hcl
# Terraform configuration example
terraform {
  required_version = ">= 1.0"
  
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "ibp-terraform-state"
    key    = "production/infrastructure.tfstate"
    region = "eu-west-1"
    encrypt = true
  }
}

# Security group with baseline configuration
resource "aws_security_group" "bms_app" {
  name_prefix = "bms-app-"
  description = "Security group for BMS application servers"
  vpc_id      = var.vpc_id

  ingress {
    from_port   = 443
    to_port     = 443
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = [var.vpc_cidr]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  tags = {
    Name        = "BMS Application Security Group"
    Environment = var.environment
    Compliance  = "Required"
  }
}
```

### 6.2 Release Management Process
Structured approach to software and configuration releases:

#### Release Planning
```yaml
Release Phases:
  Planning:
    - Release scope definition
    - Resource allocation
    - Risk assessment
    - Timeline development
  
  Development:
    - Feature implementation
    - Unit and integration testing
    - Code review and approval
    - Documentation updates
  
  Testing:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow example
name: Infrastructure Testing
on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'terraform/**'
      - 'ansible/**'

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Terraform validation
        run: |
          terraform init
          terraform validate
          terraform plan
      
      - name: Security scanning
        run: |
          checkov -d terraform/
          tfsec terraform/
      
      - name: Infrastructure testing
        run: |
          terratest_log_parser -testlog test.log
```

### 7.3 Rollback and Recovery Procedures
Comprehensive rollback capabilities for all changes:

#### Rollback Triggers
- **Automated triggers**: Performance degradation, error rate increase
- **Manual triggers**: User reports, monitoring alerts
- **Time-based triggers**: Predetermined rollback windows
- **Compliance triggers**: Regulatory violation detection

#### Rollback Procedures
```bash
# Automated rollback script example
#!/bin/bash
DEPLOYMENT_ID=$1
ROLLBACK_VERSION=$2

echo "Initiating rollback for deployment $DEPLOYMENT_ID"

# Stop current deployment
aws ecs update-service --cluster bms-cluster --service bms-app --desired-count 0

# Deploy previous version
aws ecs update-service --cluster bms-cluster --service bms-app \
  --task-definition bms-app:$ROLLBACK_VERSION --desired-count 2

# Verify rollback success
sleep 30
health_check=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" https://bms.example.com/health)
if [ $health_check -eq 200 ]; then
    echo "Rollback successful"
    # Update monitoring and documentation
else
