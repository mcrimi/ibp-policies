# Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Policy

## 1. Purpose
This policy ensures IBP and BMS can maintain operations and recover from disruptions, protecting critical services and data.

## 2. Scope
Applies to all BMS infrastructure, applications, and data hosted in AWS, covering both operational resilience and disaster recovery.

## 3. Business Impact Analysis

### 3.1 Service Criticality
| Service             | Priority  | RTO       | RPO       | Justification               |
|---------------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------------------------|
| BMS Production API  | Critical  | 4 hours   | 1 hour    | Core service for users      |
| Database (RDS)      | Critical  | 4 hours   | 1 hour    | Contains all breeding data  |
| User Authentication | Critical  | 4 hours   | 1 hour    | Required for access         |
| File Storage (S3)   | High      | 8 hours   | 4 hours   | Research documents          |
| Analytics           | Medium    | 24 hours  | 12 hours  | Non-critical reporting      |

### 3.2 Risk Scenarios
- AWS region failure  
- Data corruption or deletion  
- Cyber attack (ransomware)  
- Extended AWS service outage  
- Key personnel unavailability  

### 3.3 Impact Assessment Matrix
| Duration  | Impact Level | Business Impact              | Action Required            |
|-----------|--------------|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| < 1 hour  | Low          | Minimal user disruption      | Monitor situation          |
| 1-4 hours | Medium       | Some users affected          | Prepare for failover       |
| 4-8 hours | High         | Significant disruption       | Initiate failover          |
| > 8 hours | Critical     | Business operations at risk  | Full disaster recovery     |

## 4. Backup Strategy

### 4.1 AWS Backup Configuration
```hcl
# AWS Backup Plan (Terraform)
resource "aws_backup_plan" "bms_backup" {
  name = "bms-backup-plan"
  
  rule {
    rule_name         = "daily_backup"
    target_vault_name = aws_backup_vault.main.name
    schedule          = "cron(0 5 ? * * *)"  # 5 AM UTC daily
    
    lifecycle {
      delete_after      = 90   # Keep for 90 days
      cold_storage_after = 30  # Move to cold storage after 30 days
    }
    
    recovery_point_tags = {
      Environment = "Production"
      Frequency   = "Daily"
    }
  }
  
  rule {
    rule_name         = "weekly_backup"
    target_vault_name = aws_backup_vault.main.name
    schedule          = "cron(0 6 ? * 1 *)"  # Monday 6 AM UTC
    
    lifecycle {
      delete_after = 365  # Keep for 1 year
    }
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Backup Schedule
| Resource          | Frequency  | Retention | Method                   | Location     |
|-------------------|------------|-----------|--------------------------|--------------|
| RDS Database      | Daily      | 90 days   | AWS Backup               | eu-west-1    |
| RDS Database      | Continuous | 7 days    | Point-in-time recovery   | eu-west-1    |
| S3 Data           | Real-time  | Versioning| S3 Versioning            | eu-west-1    |
| S3 Data           | Daily      | 90 days   | Cross-region replication | eu-central-1 |
| Configuration     | On change  | 30 versions| AWS Config              | eu-west-1    |
| Infrastructure    | On commit  | Indefinite| Git repository           | GitHub       |

### 4.3 Backup Testing
- Monthly: Restore random backup to test environment  
- Quarterly: Full DR drill  
- Document test results in Confluence  
- Success criteria: Restore completed within RTO  

## 5. Disaster Recovery Plan

### 5.1 Recovery Strategy
Primary Strategy: Backup and Restore  
- Cost-effective for small team  
- RTO: 4 hours, RPO: 1 hour  
- Manual failover process  

### 5.2 DR Architecture
Primary Region (eu-west-1) → DR Region (eu-central-1)  
- RDS Multi-AZ → RDS Read Replica (promotable)  
- S3 with versioning → S3 with cross-region replication  
- EC2/ECS instances → AMIs ready for deployment  
- Application Load Balancer → ALB (dormant)  
- Route 53 DNS → Failover routing policy  

### 5.3 Failover Procedures

**Phase 1: Assessment (0-30 minutes)**  
1. Confirm primary region failure  
   - Check AWS Service Health Dashboard  
   - Verify multiple service failures  
   - Test connectivity from different locations  
2. Assess data loss potential  
   - Check last successful backup  
   - Verify replication status  
3. Notify stakeholders via Slack (#incident-response)  
4. Decision to initiate failover (IT Lead or delegate)  

**Phase 2: Failover Execution (30 minutes - 2 hours)**  
```bash
# 1. Promote RDS read replica
aws rds promote-read-replica   --db-instance-identifier bms-dr-replica   --backup-retention-period 7

# 2. Update Route 53 to point to DR region
aws route53 change-resource-record-sets   --hosted-zone-id ZXXXXXXXXXXXXX   --change-batch file://failover-dns.json

# 3. Launch EC2/ECS instances from AMIs
aws ec2 run-instances   --image-id ami-dr-latest   --instance-type t3.large   --count 2   --subnet-id subnet-dr

# 4. Update application configuration
aws ssm put-parameter   --name "/bms/database/endpoint"   --value "bms-dr.eu-central-1.rds.amazonaws.com"   --overwrite
```

**Phase 3: Validation (2-4 hours)**  
- Test critical functions (login, data retrieval, file upload/download)  
- Monitor error rates in CloudWatch  
- Communicate with users  
- Document issues in incident log  

### 5.4 Failback Procedures
1. Ensure primary region is stable (minimum 24 hours)  
2. Sync data from DR to primary  
3. Schedule maintenance window  
4. Reverse failover process  
5. Validate primary operations  
6. Update documentation
