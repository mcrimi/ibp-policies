## 4. Audit Program Management

### 4.1 Simple Audit Plan
Basic audit activities:

```yaml
Annual Audit Activities:
  Ongoing (Monthly):
    - Basic security control checks
    - Access review (informal)
    - System log reviews
  
  Mid-Year (Q2):
    - Internal security review
    - Policy compliance check
    - Basic vulnerability assessment
  
  Year-End (Q4):
    - Annual external security review
    - Compliance documentation review
    - Policy updates and improvements
```

### 4.2 Simple Audit Approach
Basic audit activities focus on essential areas:

#### Internal Reviews
- **Basic security controls**: Are passwords, MFA, and access controls working?
- **Policy compliance**: Are team members following basic security practices?
- **System security**: Are systems updated and properly configured?
- **Data protection**: Is sensitive data properly handled?

#### External Review (Annual)
- **Security assessment**: Third-party review of basic security controls
- **Vulnerability testing**: Basic penetration testing of public systems
- **Compliance check**: Verification of regulatory requirements

### 4.3 Resource Requirements

| Activity | Frequency | Resources | Duration |
|----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| Internal Review | Mid-year | Internal team | 1 week |
| External Security Review | Annual | Third-party consultant | 1-2 weeks |
| Monthly Checks | Monthly | Team lead | 1 day |

## 5. Basic Security Testing

### 5.1 Simple Security Testing Approach

#### Annual External Testing
Basic security assessment covering:

- **Configuration review**
- **Access control testing**

#### Internal Testing
Simple internal checks:
- **Monthly system updates** verification
- **Quarterly access reviews**
- **Basic log reviews**
- **Password policy compliance**

### 5.2 Basic Vulnerability Management
