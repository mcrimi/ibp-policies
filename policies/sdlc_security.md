# Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) Security Policy

## 1. Purpose
This policy establishes security requirements and controls for the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) to ensure secure development practices across IBP and BMS applications.

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all software development activities, including:
- Internal application development
- Third-party software integration
- Open source component usage
- Code review and testing processes
- Deployment and maintenance activities

## 3. SDLC Security Framework

### 3.1 Industry Standards Alignment
IBP follows industry-recognized standards for secure development:
- **OWASP Software Assurance Maturity Model (SAMM)**
- **ISO/IEC 27034** Application Security Management
- **NIST Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)**

### 3.2 Security Integration Points
Security is integrated at every SDLC phase:

| Phase | Security Activities | Deliverables |
|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| Planning | Threat modeling, security requirements | Security requirements document |
| Design | Security architecture review, data flow analysis | Security design document |
| Development | Secure coding, static analysis | Code review reports |
| Testing | Dynamic testing, penetration testing | Security test results |
| Deployment | Security configuration, vulnerability scanning | Deployment security checklist |
| Maintenance | Patch management, ongoing monitoring | Security maintenance reports |

## 4. Secure Development Practices

### 4.1 Security Requirements
All development projects must include:
- **Security requirements specification** based on data classification
- **Threat modeling** to identify potential attack vectors
- **Risk assessment** for new features and integrations
- **Compliance mapping** to regulatory requirements

### 4.2 Secure Coding Standards
Developers must follow established secure coding practices:

#### Code Quality Requirements
```yaml
Secure Coding Standards:
  Java/Spring Framework Specific:
    - Spring Security: Utilize Spring Security framework for authentication/authorization
    - Input Validation: Use Spring Validation annotations (@Valid, @Validated)
    - SQL Injection Prevention: Use Hibernate parameterized queries and JPA criteria API
    - XSS Prevention: Proper encoding in Thymeleaf templates and AngularJS sanitization
    - CSRF Protection: Enable Spring Security CSRF protection
    - Session Management: Configure Spring Security session management
  
  Database Security (MySQL/Hibernate):
    - Connection Security: Use SSL connections to MySQL databases
    - Prepared Statements: Mandatory use of Hibernate parameterized queries
    - Database User Privileges: Separate database users with minimal privileges per component
    - Multi-tenant Security: Secure database switching for crop-specific databases
  
  API Security (BMSAPI):
    - REST Security: Implement OAuth 2.0 or JWT token authentication
    - Rate Limiting: Implement API rate limiting and throttling
    - Input Validation: Validate all API inputs using Spring Validation
    - Error Handling: Standardized error responses without sensitive information
```

#### Prohibited Practices
- Hard-coded credentials or secrets
- SQL injection vulnerable code patterns
- Unvalidated redirects and forwards
- Insecure direct object references
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities

### 4.3 Third-Party Software Management
All third-party components are subject to security review:

#### Vendor Assessment Process
1. **Security questionnaire** completion by vendor
2. **Vulnerability assessment** of vendor products
3. **License compliance** review
4. **Data handling practices** evaluation
5. **Ongoing monitoring** of vendor security posture

#### Open Source Component Management
```bash
# Maven dependency scanning for BMS Java components
mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check
mvn versions:display-dependency-updates

# JavaScript dependency scanning for AngularJS/jQuery components
npm audit --audit-level moderate
npm audit fix

# Specific BMS technology stack scanning
# Spring Framework vulnerability scanning
mvn org.springframework:spring-context:check-vulnerabilities
# Hibernate ORM security scanning
mvn org.hibernate:hibernate-core:security-scan
```

## 5. Security Testing Requirements

- **SpotBugs** (formerly FindBugs) for Java static analysis
- **ESLint** with security plugins for JavaScript/AngularJS code
- **Custom rules** for BMS-specific security requirements (multi-database access patterns, crop-specific data handling)

### 5.2 Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
Runtime security testing before production deployment:
- **OWASP ZAP** for automated vulnerability scanning
- **Burp Suite Professional** for manual testing
- **AWS Inspector** for infrastructure assessment

### 5.3 Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST)
Real-time security testing during development:
- **Contrast Security** or similar IAST tools
- **Integration** with development environment
- **Continuous feedback** to developers

### 5.4 Penetration Testing
Annual comprehensive penetration testing:
- **External testing** of public-facing applications
- **Internal testing** of network and systems
- **Third-party assessors** with relevant certifications
- **Remediation tracking** for identified vulnerabilities

## 6. Code Review Process

### 6.1 Mandatory Security Reviews
All code changes require security review:

#### Review Criteria
```yaml
Security Review Checklist:
  Authentication:
    - Multi-factor authentication implemented where required
    - Session management follows best practices
    - Password policies enforced
  
  Authorization:
    - Role-based access control properly implemented
    - Privilege escalation prevented
    - Data access controls enforced
  
  Data Protection:
    - Sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
    - Data validation and sanitization implemented
    - PII handling complies with privacy regulations
  
  Error Handling:
    - Generic error messages for security-sensitive operations
    - Proper logging without exposing sensitive information
