# Notes
1) This seems to be âœ…
2) In the responses folder there's a final extract called questionnaire_bayer.xlsx.
2.1) This is a clumpsy merge of the responseses that I used at the begining of the questionnaire
(had some problems with Claude that didn't allow me to do a beter export, so I copy pasted from the chat interface)
2.2) The second part that I merged is also a Claude response table, but this time exported in CSV
3) I used Cursor (with Claude) to merge the two, which I THINK worked well
4) In any case I changed and reviewd some of the actual responses (I tried an html export, but it only kind of captures y/n)
